    "## 2. Applying noise\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness of filtering techniques, we first need to simulate noisy conditions by adding noise to our image. Introducing noise allows us to assess how well each filter can reduce or eliminate unwanted disturbances without overly blurring important details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Noise Added:\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Noise**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Gaussian noise is continuous and follows a normal distribution, where the noise has random values centered around a mean with some variance. This noise type is commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, and is considered a type of additive noise, usually gaussian filters ge trid of gaussian noise pretty well, and taht is what we are going to try out.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Gaussian noise provides a challenging test case for filters, as it affects every pixel in the image. Testing filters on Gaussian noise helps determine their ability to smooth continuous disturbances and maintain image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Salt-and-pepper noise introduces random black (pepper) and white (salt) pixels throughout the image, creating a \"speckled\" effect. This noise often results from bit errors in image transmission or low-light environments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Salt-and-pepper noise is particularly challenging for filters because it creates stark, isolated pixel variations. Filters need to remove these extreme outliers effectively without blurring surrounding areas, making it a strong test for adaptive filtering methods, like the median filter, which handles this type of noise effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying both Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise, we can examine the versatility of each filtering method and how well they address different noise characteristics.\n",

    "## 3. Basic Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic image filters are foundational in image processing, often applied to reduce noise or blur specific details to achieve desired effects. This section covers three commonly used filters—**Box Filter**, **Gaussian Filter**, and **Median Filter**—each serving different purposes in image smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Box Filter**:\n",
    "   - This filter replaces each pixel's value with the average value of the pixels in a surrounding box-shaped neighborhood (kernel).\n",
    "   - It provides a simple blur effect, softening edges and reducing fine details, but is less effective at preserving sharp edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gaussian Filter**:\n",
    "   - Gaussian filtering uses a kernel that follows a Gaussian distribution, applying a weighted average where pixels closer to the center contribute more heavily.\n",
    "   - This filter produces a more natural blur and is commonly used for noise reduction, offering a gentler smoothing effect than the box filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Median Filter**:\n",
    "   - The median filter replaces each pixel with the median value of the pixels within its kernel, making it especially effective at removing salt-and-pepper noise.\n",
    "   - This filter preserves edges better than averaging filters since it reduces extreme pixel values without spreading them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `apply_simple_filters` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `apply_simple_filters` function applies one of these three filters to an image, with options for both grayscale and color images. Key parameters in the function are:\n",
    "- `filter_type`: Specifies the filter to apply (`'box filter'`, `'gaussian filter'`, or `'median filter'`).\n",
    "- `colored`: Indicates whether the image is colored or grayscale. When colored, each channel (Blue, Green, Red) is processed separately.\n",
    "- `kernel_size`: Defines the size of the kernel (odd integer) for the filtering operation. Larger kernel sizes increase the level of smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function processes each color channel individually if the image is colored, ensuring the filter is applied to each channel consistently. It then merges the filtered channels back together for the final output. This flexibility makes it a versatile tool for basic image smoothing tasks in color or grayscale formats."

    "## 1. The Box Filter\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Median Filter**:\n",
    "   - **Execution Time**: The slowest filter with an average execution time of **496 ms** per loop.\n",
    "   - **Reason**: The Median Filter requires sorting neighboring pixels to compute the median, which is computationally intensive, especially for large kernels.\n",

    "2. **Gaussian Filter**:\n",
    "   - **Execution Time**: Significantly faster than the Median Filter, averaging **43.5 ms** per loop.\n",
    "   - **Reason**: The Gaussian Filter uses a weighted sum of neighboring pixels, which is computationally efficient and benefits from optimized mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Box Filter**:\n",
    "   - **Execution Time**: The fastest filter, averaging **35.4 ms** per loop.\n",

    "1. **Box Filter**: Most efficient filter with the lowest execution time.\n",

    "  - **Trade-off**: High computational cost.\n",

    "- **Gaussian Filter**:\n",
    "  - **Best For**: Smoothing images while maintaining some detail, with better performance than the Median Filter.\n",

For real-time applications, the **Box Filter** is the best option, while the **Median Filter** is ideal for applications requiring noise reduction with edge preservation, despite its slower performance.\n"

    "### **1. Run Time Comparison**\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of execution speed, the **Bilateral Filter** stands out as the fastest option by a large margin:\n",

    "- **Gaussian Noise**:\n",
    "  - When dealing with **Gaussian Noise**, the **Bilateral Filter** demonstrates a surprising advantage. It not only **outperforms** the **Adaptive Median Filter** in terms of **SQNR** and **MSE**, but it also achieves a **lower MSE** while maintaining the image’s integrity more effectively.\n",

    "This long but insightful experiment allowed us to explore a versatile set of filters and observe their impact on images with varying levels of complexity. Throughout the process, we gained valuable insights into how different filters perform, especially when applied to color images. \n",
    "\n",
    "One key takeaway is the potential to significantly speed up the filtering process by leveraging **multiprocessing** and **GPU acceleration**, along with efficient libraries like **Numba**. These tools can help optimize the performance, making the filtering tasks much faster and more efficient.\n",
